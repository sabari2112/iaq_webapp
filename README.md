### 🎯 IAQI Categories

- **Good (0-50)**: Minimal impact
- **Satisfactory (51-100)**: Minor breathing discomfort to sensitive people
- **Moderate (101-200)**: Breathing discomfort to people with lung, asthma and heart diseases
- **Poor (201-300)**: Breathing discomfort to most people on prolonged exposure
- **Very Poor (301-400)**: Respiratory illness on prolonged exposure
- **Severe (401-500)**: Affects healthy people and seriously impacts those with existing diseases
